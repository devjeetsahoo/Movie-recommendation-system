## Introduction

In today's world, where the options for entertainment are endless, a well-designed movie recommendation system can be a game-changer. Content-based filtering is a powerful approach that analyzes the characteristics of movies, such as their genres, plot summaries, and cast, to identify similarities and suggest titles that a user is likely to enjoy.

## Features

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on the similarity of their content.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Uses cosine similarity to measure the similarity between movies.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Groups similar movies together for more accurate recommendations.
- **Personalization**: Incorporates user feedback to continuously improve recommendations.
